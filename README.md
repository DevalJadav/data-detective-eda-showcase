# 🕵️‍♂️ Data Detective – EDA Showcase

## 🔍 Project Overview
Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) showcase!  
This repository is a collection of hands-on projects where I dive into diverse datasets to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights using Python data science tools. Each dataset tells a unique story—and this is my way of decoding them.

As an MSc Data Science student at the University of Roehampton, this project marks the beginning of my journey into data storytelling and model-building.

## 📊 Datasets Explored
- **Titanic Dataset** – Survival patterns based on age, class, and gender. *(Completed ✅)*
- **London Transport** – Time-based trends and passenger volumes across boroughs. *(Coming Soon ⏳)*

New datasets will be added regularly to reflect my growth and exploration.
